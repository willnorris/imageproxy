# imageproxy [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/willnorris/imageproxy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/willnorris/imageproxy) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/willnorris.com/go/imageproxy?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/willnorris.com/go/imageproxy) [![Apache 2.0 License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-blue.svg?style=flat)](LICENSE)

imageproxy is a caching image proxy server written in go.  It features:

 - basic image adjustments like resizing, cropping, and rotation
 - access control using host whitelists or request signing (HMAC-SHA256)
 - support for jpeg, png, webp & tiff (decode only), and gif image formats (including animated gifs)
 - on-disk caching, respecting the cache headers of the original images
 - easy deployment, since it's pure go

Personally, I use it primarily to dynamically resize images hosted on my own
site (read more in [this post][]).  But you can also enable request signing and
use it as an SSL proxy for remote images, similar to [atmos/camo][] but with
additional image adjustment options.

## URL Structure ##

imageproxy URLs are of the form `http://localhost/{options}/{remote_url}`.

### Options ###

Options are available for cropping, resizing, rotation, flipping, and digital
signatures among a few others.  Options for are specified as a comma delimited
list of parameters, which can be supplied in any order.  Duplicate parameters
overwrite previous values.

See the full list of available options at
<https://godoc.org/willnorris.com/go/imageproxy#ParseOptions>.

### Remote URL ###

The URL of the original image to load is specified as the remainder of the
path, without any encoding.  For example,
`http://localhost/200/https://willnorris.com/logo.jpg`.

In order to [optimize caching][], it is recommended that URLs not contain query
strings.

### Examples ###

The following live examples demonstrate setting different options on [this
source image][small-things], which measures 1024 by 678 pixels.

## Getting Started ##

Install the package using:

    go get willnorris.com/go/imageproxy/cmd/imageproxy

(Note that go1.2 and earlier may have trouble fetching the package with `go
get`).

Once installed, ensure `$GOPATH/bin` is in your `$PATH`, then run the proxy
using:

    imageproxy

This will start the proxy on port 8080, without any caching and with no host
whitelist (meaning any remote URL can be proxied).  Test this by navigating to
<http://localhost:8080/500/https://octodex.github.com/images/codercat.jpg> and
you should see a 500px square coder octocat.

### Cache ###

By default, the imageproxy command does not cache responses, but caching can be
enabled using the `-cache` flag.  It supports the following values:

 - `memory` - uses an in-memory cache.  (This can exhaust your system's
   available memory and is not recommended for production systems)
 - directory on local disk (e.g. `/tmp/imageproxy`) - will cache images
   on disk
 - s3 URL (e.g. `s3://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/my-bucket`) - will cache
   images on Amazon S3.  This requires either an IAM role and instance profile
   with access to your your bucket or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_KEY`
   environmental parameters set.

For example, to cache files on disk in the `/tmp/imageproxy` directory:

    imageproxy -cache /tmp/imageproxy

Reload the [codercat URL][], and then inspect the contents of
`/tmp/imageproxy`.  Within the subdirectories, there should be two files, one
for the original full-size codercat image, and one for the resized 500px
version.

[codercat URL]: http://localhost:8080/500/https://octodex.github.com/images/codercat.jpg

### Referrer Whitelist ###

You can limit images to only be accessible for certain hosts in the HTTP
referrer header, which can help prevent others from hotlinking to images. It can
be enabled by running:

    imageproxy  -referrers example.com


Reload the [codercat URL][], and you should now get an error message.  You can
specify multiple hosts as a comma separated list, or prefix a host value with
`*.` to allow all sub-domains as well.

### Host whitelist ###

You can limit the remote hosts that the proxy will fetch images from using the
`whitelist` flag.  This is useful, for example, for locking the proxy down to
your own hosts to prevent others from abusing it.  Of course if you want to
support fetching from any host, leave off the whitelist flag.  Try it out by
running:

    imageproxy -whitelist example.com

Reload the [codercat URL][], and you should now get an error message.  You can
specify multiple hosts as a comma separated list, or prefix a host value with
`*.` to allow all sub-domains as well.

### Signed Requests ###

Instead of a host whitelist, you can require that requests be signed.  This is
useful in preventing abuse when you don't have just a static list of hosts you
want to allow.  Signatures are generated using HMAC-SHA256 against the remote
URL, and url-safe base64 encoding the result:

    base64urlencode(hmac.New(sha256, <key>).digest(<remote_url>))

The HMAC key is specified using the `signatureKey` flag.  If this flag
begins with an "@", the remainder of the value is interpreted as a file on disk
which contains the HMAC key.

Try it out by running:

    imageproxy -signatureKey "secret key"

Reload the [codercat URL][], and you should see an error message.  Now load a
[signed codercat URL][] and verify that it loads properly.

[signed codercat URL]: http://localhost:8080/500,sXyMwWKIC5JPCtlYOQ2f4yMBTqpjtUsfI67Sp7huXIYY=/https://octodex.github.com/images/codercat.jpg

Some simple code samples for generating signatures in various languages can be
found in [URL Signing](https://github.com/willnorris/imageproxy/wiki/URL-signing).

If both a whiltelist and signatureKey are specified, requests can match either.
In other words, requests that match one of the whitelisted hosts don't
necessarily need to be signed, though they can be.

### Default Base URL ###

Typically, remote images to be proxied are specified as absolute URLs.
However, if you commonly proxy images from a single source, you can provide a
base URL and then specify remote images relative to that base.  Try it out by
running:

    imageproxy -baseURL https://octodex.github.com/

Then load the codercat image, specified as a URL relative to that base:
<http://localhost:8080/500/images/codercat.jpg>.  Note that this is not an
effective method to mask the true source of the images being proxied; it is
trivial to discover the base URL being used.  Even when a base URL is
specified, you can always provide the absolute URL of the image to be proxied.

### Scaling beyond original size ###

By default, the imageproxy won't scale images beyond their original size.
However, you can use the `scaleUp` command-line flag to allow this to happen:

    imageproxy -scaleUp true

### WebP support ###

Imageproxy can proxy remote webp images, but they will be served in either jpeg
or png format (this is because the golang webp library only supports webp
decoding) if any transformation is requested.  If no format is specified,
imageproxy will use jpeg by default.  If no transformation is requested (for
example, if you are just using imageproxy as an SSL proxy) then the original
webp image will be served as-is without any format conversion.


Run `imageproxy -help` for a complete list of flags the command accepts.  If
you want to use a different caching implementation, it's probably easiest to
just make a copy of `cmd/imageproxy/main.go` and customize it to fit your
needs... it's a very simple command.

## Deploying ##

You can build and deploy imageproxy using any standard go toolchain, but here's
how I do it.

I use [goxc](https://github.com/laher/goxc) to build and deploy to an Ubuntu
server.  I have a `$GOPATH/willnorris.com/go/imageproxy/.goxc.local.json` file
which limits builds to 64-bit linux:

``` json
 {
   "ConfigVersion": "0.9",
   "BuildConstraints": "linux,amd64"
 }
```

I then run `goxc` which compiles the static binary and creates a deb package at
`build/0.2.1/imageproxy_0.2.1_amd64.deb` (or whatever the current version is).
I copy this file to my server and install it using `sudo dpkg -i
imageproxy_0.2.1_amd64.deb`, which is installed to `/usr/bin/imageproxy`.

Ubuntu uses upstart to manage services, so I copy
[`etc/imageproxy.conf`](etc/imageproxy.conf) to `/etc/init/imageproxy.conf` on
my server and start it using `sudo service imageproxy start`.  You will
certainly want to modify that upstart script to suit your desired
configuration.

### Heroku ###

It's easy to vendorize the dependencies with `Godep` and deploy to Heroku. Take
a look at [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/oreillymedia/prototype-imageproxy)

### Docker ###

A docker image is available at [`willnorris/imageproxy`](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/willnorris/imageproxy/dockerfile/).

You can run it by
```
docker run -p 8080:8080 willnorris/imageproxy -addr 0.0.0.0:8080
```

Or in your Dockerfile:

```
ENTRYPOINT ["/go/bin/imageproxy", "-addr 0.0.0.0:8080"]
```

### nginx ###

You can use follow config to prevent URL overwritting:

```
  location ~ ^/api/imageproxy/ {
    # pattern match to capture the original URL to prevent URL
    # canonicalization, which would strip double slashes
    if ($request_uri ~ "/api/imageproxy/(.+)") {
      set $path $1;
      rewrite .* /$path break;
    }
    proxy_pass http://localhost:8080;
  }
```
